# OS System Calls & Parallel FFT
A Comparative Study of Linux and Windows System Calls via Fourier Transform

A cross-platform systems programming project in **C** that demonstrates 15 OS-level system calls on both **Windows** and **Linux**, integrated with a **parallelized Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** pipeline using shared memory, threads/processes, and IPC.

---

## Overview

This project implements and benchmarks core operating system primitives across two platforms — Windows (Win32 API) and Linux (POSIX) — and uses those primitives to build a complete FFT computation pipeline:

- Read input signal from file using OS file I/O calls
- Store the FFT working array in shared/mapped memory
- Compute the FFT in parallel using OS threads
- Write the output spectrum to a file
- Measure and report execution time for every system call category

```

Each FFT stage splits its butterfly blocks across **2 threads** (`CreateThread` / `pthread_create`), then joins them before advancing to the next stage — giving true parallel Cooley-Tukey decomposition.

## Build & Run

### Windows

**MinGW / GCC:**
```bash
gcc windows_ccp.c -o ccp.exe -ladvapi32 -lm
./ccp.exe
```

**MSVC:**
```bash
cl windows_ccp.c /Fe:ccp.exe /link advapi32.lib
ccp.exe
```

### Linux

```bash
gcc linux_ccp.c -o ccp -lpthread -lm
./ccp
```

## Windows vs Linux Comparison

| Operation | Windows API | Linux POSIX | Key Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| File open/read/write | `CreateFile`, `ReadFile`, `WriteFile`, `CloseHandle` | `open`, `read`, `write`, `close` | Windows uses a single handle-based API with many flags; Linux uses simpler, Unix-style file descriptors |
| Process creation | `CreateProcess` | `fork` + `execlp` + `waitpid` | Windows performs creation in one call; Linux separates duplication (`fork`) and execution (`exec`) |
| Memory allocation | `VirtualAlloc`, `VirtualFree` | `mmap`, `munmap` | Linux `mmap` supports both file-backed and anonymous mapping; Windows uses page-based allocation |
| Shared memory | `CreateFileMapping`, `MapViewOfFile` | `shmget`, `shmat` | Windows uses named mapping objects; Linux uses System V IPC keys and attachment model |
| Pipe IPC | `CreatePipe` | `pipe` | Both provide unidirectional communication; Linux integrates naturally with file descriptors |
| Permissions | `SetFileSecurity` | `chmod`, `chown`, `umask` | Windows uses ACL-based security; Linux uses simpler permission bits model |
| Threads | `CreateThread`, `WaitForMultipleObjects` | `pthread_create`, `pthread_join` | POSIX threads are portable and standardized; Windows threads are OS-specific |
| Timing | `QueryPerformanceCounter` | `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` | Both provide high-resolution timing; Linux uses standardized POSIX clocks |
| Error reporting | `GetLastError()` | `errno` | Windows uses explicit API calls for errors; Linux uses global error variable (`errno`) |
| Memory mapping (FFT buffer) | `MapViewOfFile` | `mmap` | Linux directly maps memory regions; Windows requires mapping objects before access |

## Error Handling

Every system call is wrapped with an explicit return-value check. On failure:
- A `[FAIL]` entry is written to `ccp_log.txt` with context
- The program exits cleanly, freeing any allocated resources before returning

Example log entries:
```
[OK] CreateFileMappingA(FFT_MAP)
[OK] MapViewOfFile(FFT_MAP)
[OK] CreateThread worker 1
[OK] CreateThread worker 2
[OK] WaitForMultipleObjects
[OK] FFT complete + normalized
```

## Performance Notes

- **`CreateProcess` / `fork+exec`** are the slowest operations on both platforms (~0.3–0.5 sec) due to process creation overhead
- **Pipe IPC** and **shared memory setup** are both sub-millisecond
- **FFT** on N=2048 completes in under 10 ms with 2-thread parallelism per stage
- **CRT `_open`** on Windows can be slower than Win32 `CreateFile` due to the CRT translation layer

## Requirements

| Platform | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Windows | GCC (MinGW-w64) or MSVC, `advapi32.lib` |
| Linux | GCC, `libpthread`, `libm` |
| Both | C99 or later |
